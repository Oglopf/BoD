\underline{Assume}: Collections scripted $\mathscr{X}$. \\
\\
In topology \textit{collection} is used instead of \textit{set}. Usually they are synonymous, but sometimes \textit{collection} is used when discussing \textit{a set of sets} specifically. \\
\begin{defn}[Collection $\mathscr{X}$]
	A set whose elements are sets.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Topology]
	A collection $\mathscr{T}$ of subsets $X$ satisfying:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\emptyset, X \in \mathscr{T}$.
		\item For any subcollection X of $\mathscr{T}$ the union $\bigcup$ of the elements of X is in $\mathscr{T}$.
		\[\forall X \subset \mathscr{T} \; \; \bigcup_{x \in X} x \in \mathscr{T} \]
		\item For any finite subcollection X of $\mathscr{T}$ the intersection $\bigcap$ of the elements of X is in $\mathscr{T}$.
		\[ \forall {X}^{n} \subset \mathscr{T} \; \; \bigcap_{x \in {X}^{n} } x \in \mathscr{T} \]
	\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Topological Space]
	An ordered pair denoted $\mathscr{A} = (X, \mathscr{T})$. \\
	i.e. A set $X$ for which a topology $\mathscr{T}$ has been specified.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Open Set $U$]
	For $\mathscr{A} = (X, \mathscr{T})$;  $\; \; U \subset X$ and $U \in \mathscr{T}$. \\
	i.e. the subset U is a subset of the set and the subset is in the topology.
\end{defn}
In the literature, instead of $\mathscr{A} = (X, \mathscr{T})$ they will simply drop the ordered pair and refer to the set symbol $X$, similar to group theory etc convention.
